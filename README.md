This is a fun little side project I've been working on while in University.

It's inspired by an awesome programmer and content creator through this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz_13P7lRoA&t=2748s&ab_channel=TsodingDaily

He was making a cellular automata program in Typescript and I decided I wanted to try to implement the exact same one in Java. 
What is particularly interesting in Tsodings implementation is that he is using a type of table to encode the rules of different types of Cellular Automata. 

This is what his project became: https://github.com/tsoding/autocell

I went a different route and wanted to visualize different types of Cellular Automata, the one that is most famous is Conways Game of Life.
I chose to implement two more, one is called Brians Brain and the other Seeds. They still have very simple rules but even so has fun and very different characteristics.

Would love it if you tried this little program and tell me what you think!

## Usage
1. ```git clone https://github.com/Insanityandme/cellular_automata.git```
2. ```cd src```
3. ```javac CellularAutomata.java```
4. ```java CellularAutomata```
5. Done! You should now have a fully working compiled version of the single file and program I've made!
